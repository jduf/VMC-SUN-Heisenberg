VARIATIONAL MONTE-CARLO ALGORITHM FOR THE SU(N) HEISENBERG MODEL
===============================================================

The code provided here is what I wrote during my PhD thesis at the École
Polythecnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) in Frédéric Mila's group. It is aimed
to compute variational energies of the SU(N) Heisenberg model in any fully
antisymmetric irreducible representation (one or more particle per site) on
various lattices. The make transparent what the code can do, let very briefly
explain what this model is about. It describes the Mott insulating phase of a
gas of fermionic ultracold atoms trapped in optical lattice, this field belong
to quantum physics. The fermionic atoms have N internal degrees of freedom that
will be referred to as colours. On each site of the lattice, there are m<N
particles that can be exchanged with other sites.


It is based on the Monte-Carlo metropolis sampling of
fermionic Gutzwiller projected wave functions. This does not currently support
the bosonic variational wave functions based on Jastrow factors but the
structure of the code is such that this type of wave function can certainly be
added with little effort (it has already been tested in this code for SU(2) and
first neighbour Jastrow factor, so the generalisation to N>2 and long range
Jastrow is possible).

The following scientific articles are examples of what this code is able to do:


and other (unpublished) results can be found in my thesis:



It currently supports:

+ any value of N>1
+ any number of particle per site m>N
+ any number of site n
+ any simple boundary condition (periodic, antiperiodic, none)
+ any number of particle of each color (having more particles of one colour is allowed)
+ first neighbour Heisenberg model (easily generalisable to further neighbours)
+ inhomogeneous coupling between sites 


The code is commented and the documentation can be generated via Doxyfile 


It can do

+ can visualise the lattice with unit cell, site numbers, basis vectors, hopping amplitude, fluxes 

It requires

+ c++ 4.9.2 (can maybe work with older version)

All the following softwares are not essential be should be present to use this
code at its best potential. Indeed, the visualisation of the results, already
implemented in the code, relies on:

+ gnuplot 
+ latex 
+ ReStructuedText 
+ rst2html 
+ rst2latex 
+ pdflatex 
+ latex 
+ dvipdf 
+ pdfcrop 
+ imagemagick 
+ firefox 

All these software can be set and personalised in the Linux.hpp and Linux.cpp
files. For instance imagemagick is not available to convert images, only these
two files require some changes.
